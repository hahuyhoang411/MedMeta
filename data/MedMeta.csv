However, given the observational nature of the data and the lack of large randomized controlled trials, these findings should be interpreted with caution. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes is currently very low to low, underscoring the need for higher quality studies to validate these preliminary results. Future research, particularly large-scale randomized clinical trials, is warranted to confirm the potential benefits of a GFD in glycemic control for this population and to provide more definitive guidance for clinical practice.","20817171, 12087007, 27720243, 24117620, 28338063, 31984648, 35243123","March 30, 2025",7

In studies in real-life patients, metformin has shown benefit in tumors of prostate and gynecological origin, however, there are currently no clinical trials that have evaluated the benefit of metformin in combination with radiotherapy in solid tumors.

The evidence supports a nuanced approach to prescribing these medications, tailored to the individual patient’s cardiovascular risk and existing comorbidities, to maximize both glycemic and cardiac outcomes.

10,"Systematic Review on Efficacy, Effectiveness, and Safety of Pitavastatin in Dyslipidemia in Asia",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39791666/#full-view-affiliation-2,39791666,"Pitavastatin at 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg effectively treats dyslipidemia by significantly reducing LDL-C levels after at least two months of treatment. The higher the dose, the more significant the reduction in LDL. The lowest dose of pitavastatin can reduce LDL-C by 37% to 38%, comparable to statins with moderate intensity. A dose of 2 mg can reduce LDL-C by approximately 33% to 43%, similar to the efficacy of atorvastatin 10 mg in short-term treatment (2–4 months), although its long-term effectiveness (over 1 year) remains uncertain. Pitavastatin at 2–4 mg is as effective in lowering LDL-C as rosuvastatin at 2.5–5 mg. However, pitavastatin is less effective at a fixed dose of 2 mg than rosuvastatin, 5 mg, and 10 mg. Compared to less commonly used statins, pitavastatin 2 mg is more effective than pravastatin 10 mg and equivalent to pravastatin 40 mg and simvastatin 20 mg after 2–3 months of treatment.
Adverse effects on the musculoskeletal system, such as myalgia, were observed with pitavastatin use, but the incidence was very low, and the symptoms were mild. Biochemical parameters indicated increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and creatine kinase levels, suggesting muscle toxicity potentially, but these increases did not exceed the allowable thresholds. Most trials did not report any serious adverse effects, such as rhabdomyolysis. Overall, pitavastatin was well tolerated and safe throughout the treatment period.","33261312, 19075492, 24586502, 28029012, 16733299, 20179259, 21498906, 22836071, 11996957, 16154486, 18158077, 31987664, 23672789, 24098467, 18472103, 18640465, 12040967","December 31, 2024",17

14,Diagnosis accuracy of machine learning for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40235000/,40235000,"This study systematically evaluated the diagnostic performance of machine learning (ML) based on high-resolution CT imaging for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). The results demonstrate that ML models leverage their strengths in data processing and pattern recognition to achieve rapid and efficient disease classification with high sensitivity and specificity. This highlights the potential of AI-based imaging diagnostic tools in enhancing early disease screening efficiency and reducing human error.

From a clinical standpoint, machine learning models can proficiently tackle the observer variability that is inherent in conventional diagnostic methods. Specifically, they can improve both consistency and accuracy in multidisciplinary collaborative diagnoses. Furthermore, this study conducts a systematic comparison between machine learning and traditional clinical radiological diagnostic approaches, validating the capability of machine learning to enhance diagnostic efficiency for IPF and UIP. This could serve as a foundation for its incorporation into future clinical practice. Given these findings, prospective clinical applications might include the integration of machine learning algorithms into hospital imaging analysis systems, facilitating expedited and more precise early screening for pulmonary fibrosis, minimizing diagnostic cycles, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

Nevertheless, the utilization of these technologies necessitates additional extensive models and multicenter clinical trials to further confirm their applicability and effectiveness in diverse clinical environments. Consequently, although the existing findings underscore the considerable promise of machine learning, its broad implementation in clinical practice still demands thoughtful advancement.","33547645, 36254789, 35814761, 14746399, 15269016, 30232049, 35405110, 31483764, 25551822, 35678861, 32857594, 37838076, 37844797, 38141538, 38207093, 38343230","April 15, 2025",16

Patient-reported outcome measures, such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and SF-12/SF-36/EQ-5D, consistently demonstrated pain improvement and greater improvement in quality of life in the pregabalin group. Furthermore, the pregabalin group exhibited lower opioid consumption, which may indicate its potential as an alternative or adjunct to opioids in pain management. Adverse events analysis revealed a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting in the gabapentin group. Physicians may consider the potential benefits of pregabalin based on these results, but individual patient characteristics and preferences should also be taken into account when making treatment decisions. These findings serve as a valuable reference for future research, guideline development, and clinical decision-making in the field of pain management, advancing our understanding of optimal pharmacological approaches for neuropathic pain.","28185319, 23572323, 23731598, 22345870, 33563173, 17919547, 24837444, 21745832, 22159931, 20678683, 23186035, 17875242, 21883712, 20113408","January 15, 2025",14

Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between IGF1R expression and UA levels in MG patients using single‐center clinical data. Finally, virtual drug screening was employed to identify small molecules targeting IGF1R as potential therapeutic candidates for MG. Through this research, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective role of IGF1R in MG and identify potential drug candidates for MG treatment.","22067621, 26836463, 17942520, 26707693, 32315556","March 27, 2025",5

Although for many years the only choice of insulin delivery was SC delivery, in recent years there have been various novel-based studies on oral and TD insulin delivery. These TD-based insulin delivery methods found that TD insulin delivery methods were the best alternative because most of them were more effective, safe, and preferable over SC delivery. If they are not more effective, safe, and preferable, at least they are equally effective, safe, and preferable with SC insulin delivery.
